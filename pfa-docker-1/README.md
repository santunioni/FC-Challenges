# Node app + MySQL + Nginx

- Make the scripts executable: `chmod +x scriptUp.sh` and `chmod +x scriptDown.sh`
- Run the app by executing the script with `./scriptUp.sh` (open in a text editor to see what is inside before running).
- Access nginx proxy at http://localhost/modules
- Take down all the infrastructure the script above created with the other script `./scriptDown.sh`.
